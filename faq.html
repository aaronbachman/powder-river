            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">1.When is the   best time to hunt?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" >All of our   hunts offer a little something different as far as expected weather, degree of   rut you will experience, and season availability of different species.  I will   give you a short look at our seasons and what your expectations might   be.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Archery - Archery combo hunts run in September with our 5 day hunts.  Early in September there will probably be some velvet on the deer horns.  This   can work to our advantage on the mature mule deer bucks as they will bed in   spots where the insects aren't bothering them as much.  For spot and stalk this   can be an advantage for us.  The antelope rut begins in early September and   peaks mid-month.  For decoying antelope we need at least some degree of rut.    Most other archery antelope is in water hold blinds so hot and dry is best.    The elk begin rut in September and they generally continue through early   October.  All archery hunts have some things like these I have pointed out and   all these variables hinge at least partly on the weather.  In general, it should   be warm to hot early in September and gradually cooling as the fall   progresses.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Rifle   deer/antelope combo - Our first four hunts are 5 day hunts that begin late in   October and run through early November.  These hunts are deer hunts with the   hunters who apply and draw the antelope license, combine the hunt with deer and   antelope.  Our last three hunts are later in November and are for deer only as   antelope season has ended.  Mule deer rut normally starts fairly early in November and peaks around mid-month.  Whitetail rut is generally 5-10 days later   than the mule deer.</div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">2. What kind of camp do you have?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Our camps are   comfortable ranch style camps.  Each camp has heated cabins with running water,   toilets and showers.  You will eat family style meals in the   cookhouse both morning and night.  Your guide will pack a lunch to eat in the   field.  Camps are easily accessible with rental cars.  We have several cabins at   the camps and can accommodate single hunters as well as larger groups.  Couples   will have their own room and we generally don't have to combine hunters from   different groups in the same cabins.</div>
          <h3 class="FAQ_Question"><br />
          3. How many   hunters will be in camp each week?          </h3>
          <p><br />
          </p>
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">We can   comfortably hold 14 hunters in camp each hunt.  We generally try to book 12 per   hunt but if we have 10 booked for the week and have a group of 4 needing to   book, we will have 14 that week.  Our average week is 12 hunters, althoug we   have had more than 14 on rare occasions.</div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">4. How do I   get licensed? </h3>
          </div>
          <br />

          <div class="NormalText" align="left">You need to put in for the draw, either a a Big Game Combo or Deer/Elk Combo and the dealine is March 15, see DNR for more info <a href="http://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/" target="_new">here</a>. All bow   hunters must purchase an archery stamp before hunting.  These are available here   in Broadus or from the State of Montana.  Montana licensing information phone   number is (406)444-2950.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">NEW LICENSE CHANGES: Antelope archery tags are now on a draw basis and   may or may not be unlimited. Archery elk hunters are now required to draw for an   archery elk permit.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">We will try   to keep all our clients abreast of licensing changes.  We have very limited input   and absolutely NO control of cost and availability of Montana hunting licenses.    All our clients must have proper licenses for the hunt.  Archery Antelope is in unit 900.</div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">5. What are   other costs involved?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Our hunters   are responsible for transportation to camp.  People flying will need to rent a   car to drive to camp.  We skin and cape all the animals, but meat processing and   taxidermy is your responsibility.  Meals are provided as is transportation   during the hunt.  We have a meat processor in Broadus and we will take carcasses   there but the processing cost is your responsibility.  In Broadus there are   currently three taxidermy businesses and our hunters are encouraged to look at   their work and make arrangements with them if they desire.  Meat processing or the fee for donating the meat along with taxidermy and shipping is your responsibility</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Tips for the   guide and cook are certainly encouraged although not mandatory.  The vast   majority of our past clients have shown an appreciation of their hard work and   dedication by leaving tips.  There are several taxidermists in Broadus as well as a couple others within MT that we recommend.</div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">6. What   caliber of gun should I bring?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Easy - the   one you shoot the best!  Most hunters use mid-caliber (.257 to .338) with good   scopes.  Average shot is around 150-200 yds.</div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">7. What will   the weather be like?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Old timers   always said that only newcomers and fools predict the weather in Montana.  Early   archery will probably be hot.  As the season progresses we expect cooler to cold   weather.  Rain or snow is apt to happen at any time and the wind will probably   blow.  Come prepared for the worst and hope for the best.  We have archery   hunted when the daytime high has hit 100 degrees for 2 straight weeks.  We have   also archery hunted the same two weeks in a different year when we experience   freezing nights and rain turning to snow.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Our rifle   hunts begin in October and we expect middle range temperatures during the days   and freezing nights.  As the season progresses, the chance of colder, snowy   weather increases.  As an example, Thanksgiving at camp has had temperature   extremes from 65 degrees in 1992 to 45 degrees below zero in   1981.</div>
          <br />
        
         <div>
            <h3 class="FAQ_Question">8. Can I bring a non-hunting companion?</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left">Yes, you may bring your non-hunting companion for $150/day.</div>
