          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" >An exciting, versatile hunt and a good choice for hunters unable to hunt in Montana frequently. You will be allowed to take either a whitetail or mule deer, antelope, as well as a wide variety of other upland game birds. Very respectable trophies can be taken on this hunt as it is not uncommon to see over one hundred animals, and sometimes more, a day. Some of our biggest trophies are killed on our early hunts and you can take any animal you choose. Visit our Licenses page or Booking page for more information.</div>

            <h3 class="FAQ_Question" align="left" style="padding-left:10px;">Trophy Hunts</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" >After the opening hunts the weather triggers the rut concentrating the game. Are you willing to endure the cold and hunt hard from sunrise to sunset? Can you pass up the smaller bucks you will see? If so, this is the hunt for you! Our area is unique for several reasons. First, local game counts confirm that you can expect to see a very high ratio of bucks to does. Also there appears to be a very high ratio of non-typical mule deer. Best of all, we have large whitetail and mule deer bucks.</div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" >We adhere to the principles of “fair chase,” but within these bounds every effort is made to obtain the very best trophy available.  Visit our Licenses page or Booking page for more information.</div>

            <h3 class="FAQ_Question" align="left" style="padding-left:10px;">Archery Hunts</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" style="padding-bottom:50px;">We welcome bow hunters! As experienced bow hunters ourselves, we understand the conditions necessary for close range stalking and a successful hunt. Because of the size of the area, and the fact that we limit the number of hunters, our area is not over hunted. In short, we can help you experience this ultimate challenge. Visit our Licenses page or Booking page for more information.</div>

            <h3 class="FAQ_Question" align="left" style="padding-left:10px;">Back Country Deer and Elk Camp</h3>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="NormalText" align="left" style="padding-bottom:50px;">Our camp is located in the Little Belt Mountains in the Helena – Lewis & Clark National Forrest in Central Montana. From the trailhead our pack mules and horses will take you and your gear on approximately a 5 mile ride to the base camp which is at about 6000 feet. Base camp consists of a large cook tent, guide tent, sleeping tents, shower tent and of course an outhouse! This camp is operated under a special use permit with the Helena – Lewis & Clark National Forrest. This area is closed to all motorized vehicles so all hunting is done via horseback, mules or simply walking.  The terrain can be steep and rugged but also consists of open meadows surrounded by thick timber.  Over 20 years ago, several thousand acres of the national forest was burned and the recovering area serves as an abundant feeding ground for the deer, elk and some black bears.  If you are looking for a true back country hunting experience, you will not be disappointed!</div>
